**This is absurdly unfinished and is not suitable for use.**

## Usage

1. Lower expectations. This barely does anything, yet.

3. `rake` (or use a rake task depending on your needs -- see `rake -T`).

*Better instructions coming soon.*

### Configuration

See `config.yaml.dist`. Create a `config.yaml` based on it.
